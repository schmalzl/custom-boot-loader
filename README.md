# custom bootloader

### Overview
This is a simple bootloader that anyone can use in their operating system. Just a bootloader that loads a kernel.cpp file.
NOTE: The makefile is adapted to my needs. Make sure to adapt it to yours.

### What its capable of doing
So far, it loads into graphics mode and then switches to protected mode and uses the kernel.cpp file to display a colorful gradient.
