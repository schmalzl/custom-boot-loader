# custom bootloader

### Overview
This is a simple bootloader that anyone can use in their operating system. Just a bootloader that loads a kernel.cpp file.
NOTE: The makefile is adapted to my needs. Make sure to adapt it to yours.

NOTE 2: It currently only loads into text mode, so no graphics right now...
